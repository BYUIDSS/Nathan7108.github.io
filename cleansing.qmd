# Data Cleansing & Validation

## Industrial Data Extractor & Filtering System

During my role at Transpara, I developed a comprehensive data extraction and filtering system for industrial sensor data. While not traditional "data cleansing," this work involved critical data quality processes:

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Data Validation**: Implemented validation rules to filter out corrupted sensor readings and invalid data points
- **Duplicate Detection**: Created algorithms to identify and remove duplicate entries from real-time data streams
- **Data Quality Assurance**: Built automated systems to ensure data integrity before processing by internal calculations

### Technical Implementation:
- **Real-time Processing**: Handled high-volume industrial data streams with minimal latency
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery systems for data pipeline failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient filtering algorithms to handle large datasets
- **Quality Metrics**: Automated reporting on data quality and filtering effectiveness

### Impact:
- Improved data reliability for data extractors and internal calculations
- Reduced false positives in anomaly detection systems
- Enhanced system performance through cleaner data streams
- Established data quality standards for industrial applications

*This experience taught me that effective data filtering is often more valuable than traditional "cleansing" in real-time industrial environments where data quality directly impacts operational decisions.*
