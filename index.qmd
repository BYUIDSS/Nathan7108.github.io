# Hello, I'm Nathan Luckock

## Full-Time Software Developer & Computer Science Student

I build real-world backend systems that connect industrial data to modern platforms. My work spans API development, data streaming, containerized deployment, and cloud integration.

I'm currently studying Computer Science at BYU–Idaho while working full-time as a software developer. My stack includes Python, FastAPI, Docker, Redis, MQTT, and Kubernetes.

## What I've Done

- Designed and deployed ODBC interface services using FastAPI  
- Integrated MQTT for real-time streaming from industrial systems  
- Built extractors to move industrial data into modern storage 
- Used Docker and Kubernetes for portable, efficient deployments  
- Created custom polling and caching layers using Redis

## What I'm Exploring

I'm transitioning into data science with plans to explore:

- **Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling** Building models to forecast trends and patterns in various datasets
- **AI Integration & LLM Applications** Working with large language models and AI agents for data analysis
- **Computer Vision & Media Generation** Exploring image processing and automated content creation
- **Natural Language Processing** Developing systems that understand and process human language

## My Goal

To combine backend engineering with applied AI and data science — building tools that are both intelligent and production-ready.
