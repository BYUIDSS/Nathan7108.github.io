# Hello, I'm Nathan Luckock

## Full-Time Software Developer & Computer Science Student

I build real-world backend systems that connect industrial data to modern platforms. My work spans API development, data streaming, containerized deployment, and cloud integration.

I’m currently studying Computer Science at BYU–Idaho while working full-time as a software developer. My stack includes FastAPI, Docker, Redis, MQTT, and Kubernetes — and I’ve built scalable services used in production.

## What I’ve Done

- Designed and deployed ODBC interface services using FastAPI  
- Integrated MQTT for real-time streaming from industrial systems  
- Built extractors to move crypto and industrial data into modern storage (T-Store)  
- Used Docker and Kubernetes for portable, efficient deployments  
- Created custom polling and caching layers using Redis

## What I'm Exploring

I’m transitioning into data science with plans to build:

- **Predictive Modeling with Historical Time-Series Data** An ML model (LSTM/XGBoost) that analyzes historical data to forecast future trends in industrial output, resource demand, or financial metrics. Features dynamic visualizations and real-time predictions for operational decision-making.

  
- **AI-Powered Script-to-Video Generation Pipeline** A comprehensive pipeline that transforms written scripts into short video content using LLMs, image/video APIs, and voice synthesis. Demonstrates advanced AI coordination across language processing, media generation, and rendering tasks.

  
- **Natural Language Agent for Structured Data Analysis** An intelligent AI agent that interprets natural language queries and analyzes uploaded or connected data sources (e.g., CSVs). Leverages LLM technology to provide accurate, human-readable answers and visual insights from real business data.
 
## My Goal

To combine backend engineering with applied AI and data science — building tools that are both intelligent and production-ready.
